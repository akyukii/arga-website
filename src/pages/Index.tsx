      problemDescription:
        "AI agents operate with fragmented contextâ€”limited windows and no sense of priority, causing hallucinations and incomplete reasoning across large codebases.",
      solutionTitle: "Dynamic, prioritized context graph",
      solutionDescription:
        "Arga constructs a change-aware graph that continuously filters the most relevant files, diffs, and runtime signals for each service, grounding agents in real context.",
    },
    {
      problemTitle: "Lack of execution-aware validation",
      problemDescription:
        "AI can write code, but it can't verify what is written. Without isolated environments, end-to-end tests, or live browser access, it guesses instead of proving.",
      solutionTitle: "Isolated pre-deployment environments",
      solutionDescription:
        "For every PR, Arga spins up an isolated environment with read-only Kubernetes and log access, enabling real tests, traces, and synthetic checks before code merges to production.",
    },
    {
      problemTitle: "Manual CI/CD pipelines are tedious",
      problemDescription:
        "Pipelines lack agentic orchestration; dependency drift across stages forces many unnecessary reverts when prod breaks.",
      solutionTitle: "Agentic pipeline with targeted rollbacks",
      solutionDescription:
        "Arga validates dependency sync across various stages of the CI/CD pipeline, correlates culprit PRs, and proposes minimal, reversible changes.",
    },
    {
      problemTitle: "Slow incident triage, high cognitive load",
      problemDescription:
        "Oncall must reconstruct timelines, dependencies, and impacts from scratch across microservices.",
      solutionTitle: "Change-aware incident timelines",
      solutionDescription:
        "Arga links alerts, logs, metrics, and recent PRs into a single timeline, tracks down the root cause using context gathered from PRs, and proposes minimal rollbacks.",
